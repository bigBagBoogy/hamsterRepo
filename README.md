# Welcome to the HamsterRepo! #

We aim to create a closed hamster NFT trading platform, WITH hamster tokens!

What does "closed" mean?
The tokens cannot directly be bought with money or obtained by swapping against other tokens or crypto.
and... the nft's maybe should not leave the platform.
That last one I'm still thinking about. Should there still be a backdoor to export an NFT out of the otherwise closed marketplace (maybe at very high cost?)
or under special (unlocking) circumstances raffle? timelock? price of eth > 10k?

Feel free to add ideas!  ;)
